# Booking Frontend (React)

This is a minimal React frontend that talks to the Django backend.

Quick start (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\HP\Desktop\тест вок\booking_project\frontend"
npm install
npm start
```

The frontend expects the backend API at http://localhost:8000/api/ You can
change the base URL in `src/config.js`.
